# Unit 4 Project: Book App


## Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition(Client identification)
I am a student and a huge game enthusiast. I find it very challenging to determine whether the quality of a game is worth purchasing or not.

When I want to purchase a new game, I often struggle to find reliable and informative reviews, since fans mostly make the sources and those could be biased.

Sometimes it is very hard just to look for information on a specific game because it comes with many other unneeded information.

Also, the information for different games are made by different individuals on various platforms.
Therefore it makes it very hard to compare reviews of different games with each other.

We also don’t have a specific platform to share our opinion about games.

These problems come up because there is no service that brings a great number and variety of gamers into one and shares their opinion.




The lack of information and comparison will make it difficult to determine the value and quality of the game.
Knowing your own gaming experience also helps you to make good purchase decisions. Currently there are no good platforms for you to look back at what games you have and what kind of opinions you had on them.

These issues can result in a poor gaming experience, such as missing opportunities to play better games and wasting money on games.


## Proposed Solution

## Success Criteria
| No. | Success critieria	         | Issue tackled       |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------|
| 1 | The user can upload their own review towards the game as a social media post. The post includes the title, publisher and content  | "We also don’t have a specific platform to share our opinion about games."  | 
| 2 | There is a login and registration page for each user | "These problems come up because there is no service that brings a great number and variety of gamers into one and shares their opinion." (Making a login and register system will allow the platform to have a number of users.) | 
| 3 | The user can view other social media post  | "I often struggle to find reliable and informative reviews", "Therefore it makes it very hard to compare reviews of different games with each other."  | 
| 4 | Users are able to store the games they own.  | "there are no good platforms for you to look back at what games you have" | 
| 5 | Users can search game reviews by title, post creator and publisher.  | "Sometimes it is very hard just to look for information on a specific game because it comes with many other unneeded information."  | 
| 6 | User can have their own profile page that displays their own posts and . | "Currently there are no good platforms for you to look back at what games you have and what kind of opinions you had on them." |
